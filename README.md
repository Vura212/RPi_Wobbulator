About gryrmln/RPi_Wobbulator
============================

This is about http://github.com/gryrmln/RPi_Wobbulator
forked from http://github.com/mi0iou/RPi_Wobbulator

If you want stability, use the original http://github.com/mi0iou/RPi_Wobbulator

This is my effort to:
* **learn Python**, I am an experienced software developer but a Python newbie
* improve the source, squash bugs, re-write it to use Pythonic techniques
* add functionality that I would like to have in the RPi_Wobbulator
* get some practice using git with a *public* repository
* give someting back to the community that has given so much to me

If you are an experienced Python programmer, then please browse the source and
send a report (including example corrections if possible) about anything that 
makes you wince. If you are not, then please still report any bugs that you find.
