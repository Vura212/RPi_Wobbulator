Wobby/DDS.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
WIP: Add __main__ with basic test routine


Wobby/ADC.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
WIP: Add __main__ with basic test routine

Fix incorrect method naming:
'write' is a 'simple' write that writes the given byte and nothing more.

'read' is a 'complex' read, that is, it configures and then performs
multiple accesses to resolve and return an absolute voltage value
from the ADC.

rename the 'simple' write to 'raw_write',
create a companion simple read 'raw_read'.
 

Add method to support ADC in continous conversion mode:
    need to be careful here, exactly 'how' is the User
    application going to want to use this ?

    threading & semaphores ?
    callback ?
    polling ?
    blocking ?

    Does (the) python (User) favour any particular one of these strategies ?
